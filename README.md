# Password Generator

## Description
In this weeks challenge I created an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected. How many characters would your password contain? If you want your password to have any numbers ,lowerCase, Uppercase, and Special characters.

- One of the primary motivations for creating a password generator is to improve the security of login passwords. By generating random, complex passwords, it becomes much more difficult for hackers to crack your password.
- Creating strong passwords can be difficult, especially if you need to come up with multiple unique passwords for different accounts. A password generator can make the process of creating strong passwords much easier by generating random passwords that meet certain criteria
-  It can be difficult for people to come up with complex passwords that are hard to guess or crack. A password generator can generate random, complex passwords that are much more secure than ones that are easy to guess.
- I learned how to create and manipulate strings in JavaScript using string methods like concat(), slice(), and substring(). using for loops to repeat certain actions and generate a certain number of characters, as well as using conditional statements to determine which characters or numbers to include in the password based on certain criteria. I learned Functions can be very useful for organizing and reusing code, as they allow you to define a set of instructions that can be called multiple times from different parts of your program. Ive also learned about JavaScript String.fromCharCode() this method is used to create a string from the given sequence of UTF-16 code units.
